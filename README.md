# java-wasm-bridge-teavm-one
An example of how to run Java in the browser with help from WebAssembly and TeaVM

git clone https://github.com/Suraj-Mohapatra/java-wasm-bridge-teavm-one.git

cd .\java-wasm-bridge-teavm-one

mvn clean package

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080

Also you can deploy the war in external servlet container but then visit http://localhost:8080/<name_of_the_war>

Note - This project is a fork of already exisiting repo on github. As I was working on Teavm api, I got to know it is experimental and the documentation and community support is not rich.
I am working on it's newest implementation. Once done, a new repo will be created
